# Tamouse's Dot Files

As many others have done, this is a repo for my standard set of dot files (e.g. `.bashrc`) 
to make setting up new boxes for development, test, and general use easier and quicker.

## Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/tamouse/my-dot-files.git .my_dot_files
    $ cd .my-dot-files
    $ ./setup.sh

Log out, then in again to make sure everything is in place.

## Development

Updating can be done directly in the local repo directory, treating it just
like any other such repo.

If you run scripts or programs that destroy the link(s), you may want to update
the local repo with those changes and relink.
